Introduction
============

This is a hacky, modified, version of the NTFS-3g driver that allows mounting a
NTFS filesystem with its NTFS Master File Table (MFT) corrupted, meaning that
the MFT and the MFTMirror do not match. The mentioned corruption makes your 
Windows system happily ask you if you want to format your drive because it is 
"unreadable".

Hopping this will save the life os someone as it did to me :D
